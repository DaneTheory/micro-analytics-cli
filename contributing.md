# Contributing

## Local setup

1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:micro-analytics/micro-analytics.git`
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you have `yarn`)
3. Run the server in dev mode with `npm run dev`, which will restart the server every time you edit the code.
